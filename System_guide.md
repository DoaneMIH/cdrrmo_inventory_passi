Core Inventory Management:
inventory.php: Acts as the primary interface for managing the inventory list. It allows users to view, search, and filter items by category, location, or stock status. For administrators, it also provides functionality for "soft" deleting individual items or performing bulk deletions.

categories.php: Manages the classification of items. It provides a system to create, update, and toggle the status of different item categories (e.g., assigning specific names, codes, and colors for visual organization).

locations.php: Used to manage physical or logical storage areas. It includes features to add or update storage locations, including their names, codes, descriptions, and storage capacities.

suppliers.php: Handles the directory of vendors. It allows the system to store and update contact information for suppliers, such as contact persons, phone numbers, emails, and physical addresses.

Transaction Processing:

receive_items.php: Facilitates the addition of stock to the system. It handles "Receive" transactions, allowing users to select an item, specify the quantity and unit cost, link it to a supplier, and record batch or expiration details.

distribute_items.php: Manages the removal or distribution of stock. It validates whether enough stock is available before allowing a user to record recipient details, the purpose of the distribution, and the quantity being moved.

transactions.php: Serves as a historical ledger for all movements. It allows users to search and filter through past "Receive" and "Distribute" transactions using criteria like date ranges, transaction types, or specific items.


Monitoring and Administration:

dashboard.php: Provides a high-level overview of the system's status. It calculates and displays key statistics, such as the total number of active items, total inventory value, and counts for low-stock items.

low_stock.php: A dedicated alert page for inventory maintenance. It specifically queries items that have fallen below their defined "minimum stock level" and provides a summary of "Critical" or "Out of Stock" items.

activity_logs.php: A security and audit tool restricted to administrators. It records system actions (like creating a category or updating a supplier) and tracks which user performed the action and when.
